# reaction-timer
A reaction timer built using Vue JS framework. Utilising beginner concepts to gain understanding of the usage of Vue. 
The web-app has two components that are rendered in the root component (App.vue).
The BlockComp is the block--button that shows up when we press "Play" after a certain time interval. 
When the BlockComp component is mounted the timer starts till the time you click on the component.
The second component (ResultsComp.vue) displays the calculated time after the action has been done on BlockComp to unmount BlockComp
from the DOM tree and display the calculated time of reaction in miliseconds.
